"""Gate the OUTCOME of releasing, not the status of the release job.

--8<-- vendoring note (local addition; stripped before the parity hash) --8<--
Vendored from wan-huiyan/agent-traffic-control, scripts/check_release_parity.py.
Do not edit locally -- fix it upstream and re-vendor, so every repo's gate agrees.

PROVENANCE, exactly:
    upstream commit  0b9ac0a  (on agent-traffic-control main)
    upstream version 1.23.1   -- a plugin.json/marketplace version; here it IS also
                                 a git tag (v1.23.1 exists), unlike the description
                                 gate's vendoring note above.
    upstream sha256  9afdae474bc453e2278ec8c9230c0951e3e415427ab01eb3e13a01e848ca240c
    vendored         2026-08-12

    Byte-identical to that upstream revision apart from this note, which sits between
    the --8<-- markers so a parity test can strip it and hash the rest.

WHOSE NUMBERS THE DOCSTRING BELOW IS QUOTING -- read this before citing any of them.
    Everything under WHY THIS EXISTS and WHAT IT CHECKS is UPSTREAM's incident and
    UPSTREAM's arithmetic: v1.13.0, the 3/4/7 split, the 26-vs-28 shallow-clone
    figure. None of it is a measurement of THIS repo, and repeating it here as if it
    were is the exact "confident wrong note" failure the baseline file guards against.

    THIS repo's own numbers, measured 2026-08-12 against origin/main @ a989d28:

        VERSION values on main with no release ......  0
        README versions VERSION never held .......... 7   1.0.0 - 1.6.0
        union, with no release ...................... 7   (all baselined, all pre-309d720)

    This repo has the same latent bug -- release.yml filtered paths: ['VERSION'] until
    the commit that adds this file -- but it has cost NOTHING, because 309d720
    (2026-05-29) introduced VERSION and release.yml in the SAME commit at VERSION=1.7.0,
    and every one of the nine values VERSION has held since has a matching release.
    Bug present, damage none. See .release-parity-accepted.

KNOWN LIMIT OF THE CHANGELOG HALF, found while sweeping eleven repos for this bug.
    changelog_versions() requires BOTH an exactly-`## Version history` heading (its
    re.split pattern does not tolerate an emoji or other decoration) AND
    `- **vX.Y.Z**` bullet entries. A table, a per-component changelog, or a
    `## 📜 Version history` heading all parse to ZERO entries -- and zero entries is
    not distinguishable, in the output, from a repo with nothing to report.

    That is why this file lands HERE and not in every repo that has the bug: this
    repo's README satisfies both conditions (16 entries read), so both halves of the
    union do real work. Measured on the sweep: memory-hygiene (table) and
    skill-anonymizer (table) read 0, context-police (emoji heading) reads 0, and
    overnight-workflows reads 2 of its 6. Do NOT port this file to those repos until
    the parser handles their format -- a union with a dead half is the defect this
    gate exists to catch, wearing the gate's own uniform.
    Tracked upstream: wan-huiyan/agent-traffic-control#41 (the changelog half reads
    zero in 5 of 11 repos, and zero looks identical to clean).

WHY THIS EXISTS

    Every other check in this repo looks forward: is the tree consistent NOW,
    will the next commit be valid. Nothing looked backwards at whether a release
    that should have been cut ever was — and for three months, one had not been.

    v1.13.0 is missing from the release list. The mechanism was a path filter on
    the release workflow (`paths: ['VERSION']`):

        43f4d62  "v1.13.0: ..."  manifests -> 1.13.0, VERSION untouched  -> no trigger
        6a49203  "v1.14.0: ..."  VERSION 1.12.0 -> 1.14.0                -> steps over it

    `1.13.0` never existed in VERSION on main, so no later push could cut it.

    The drift guard caught the mismatch at the time — validate_plugins.py went
    red on 43f4d62, check-run completed_at 2026-08-07T10:56:58Z, conclusion
    failure — and the remedy bumped to 1.14.0. That satisfied the guard and left
    the missing release permanently unreachable.

    **A guard tells you a state is wrong. It does not tell you what that wrong
    state already cost.** Fixing forward can satisfy the guard while leaving the
    damage in place, and the guard goes green, which reads as resolved.

    The release job cannot substitute for this check. Both branches of its
    create step exit 0, so its `conclusion: success` is byte-identical whether it
    cut a release or skipped one. It has a real failure path (empty VERSION), so
    a passing run looks like evidence the job works — but it cannot fail on the
    case that matters, because that case never reaches it. A passing instance of
    a check that only fails by not running is not evidence the check works.

WHAT IT CHECKS

    Every version this repo has ever CLAIMED to ship has a matching `vX.Y.Z`
    release. "Claimed to ship" is the union of two sources, and the union is
    load-bearing:

        VERSION history          — every value VERSION held on main
        README `## Version history` — every changelog entry

    **Neither source alone detects v1.13.0**, the hole this gate was written for.
    Measured on this repo:

        VERSION values with no release ................ 3   1.3.0  1.4.0  1.5.0
        README versions VERSION never held ............ 4   1.0.0  1.1.0  1.2.0  1.13.0
        union, with no release ........................ 7

    v1.13.0 shipped in the manifests and the README while VERSION stayed at
    1.12.0, so a VERSION-only check cannot see it — the value never existed there.
    A first draft of this gate checked VERSION only and reported v1.3.0/1.4.0/1.5.0
    while missing the case it was built for: a guard that cannot fail on the case
    that prompted it. Hence the union.

    Holes already known are listed in `.release-parity-accepted`, one
    `version  # reason` per line, so an accepted hole is RECORDED rather than
    silently tolerated, and a NEW hole is a hard failure. Baselining matters:
    a gate that ships red with seven historical findings gets muted inside a
    week, which is how a gate dies without anyone deciding to kill it.

USAGE

    python3 scripts/check_release_parity.py .            # needs gh + network
    python3 scripts/check_release_parity.py . --offline   # skip, exit 0, say so

    Exit 0 clean or all-holes-accepted; 1 on a new hole; 0 with a notice when the
    release list cannot be read (never fail CI on a network blip — that would be
    a gate whose own failure mode is invisible, which is the thing it exists for).
